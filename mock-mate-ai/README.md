Project Name: MockMate

Problem Statement:Preparing for interviews can be intimidating for students, especially without real-time feedback or the opportunity to simulate live interview scenarios. MockMate aims to bridge that gap by acting as an AI-powered mock interviewer that not only asks questions but also evaluates your answers and provides constructive feedback — helping users boost their confidence and readiness.


How it works:
AI Interview Simulation:
Users receive interview questions powered by AI.

Answer Submission:
Users type in their responses to simulate a real interview environment.

AI Evaluation:
The system uses Google’s Gemini API to analyze and evaluate answers like a real interviewer — giving structured feedback on improvements.

Session Storage:
All interview sessions are saved per user, enabling users to track their progress and revisit previous interviews.

Dark Mode + Simple UI:
Built with a modern, student-friendly interface with optional dark mode.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
